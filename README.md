the Task_01 was based on a synthesized transaction dataset containing 3 monthsâ€™ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers.
It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.
my job was to load and cleaning the dataset and gathering some interesting overall insights about the data.
